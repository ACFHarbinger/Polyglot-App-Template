## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- Git, and the toolchain(s) for whichever language module(s) you're touching: `uv` (Python), `npm` (TypeScript), Gradle/JDK 21 (Kotlin), `cargo` (Rust), Go 1.22+ (Go), CMake + a C++17 compiler (C++).
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as the command runner.
- `pre-commit` (`pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`).

### 1.2 Clone and bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
cp .env.example .env
just --list
```

## 2. Development Setup

Each language module is self-contained under its own top-level directory (`python/`, `typescript/`, `kotlin/`, `rust/`, `go/`, `cpp/`) with its own dependency manifest, `src/`, `test/`, `benchmark/`, and `config/`. See `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for a one-click containerized setup.

## 3. Code Style Guidelines

Follow the per-language rules in [`.agent/rules/`](../.agent/rules/). All modules are linted/formatted automatically via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing.

## 4. Git Workflow

- Branch from `main`: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Keep commits focused; write commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*.
- Rebase onto `main` before opening a PR.

## 5. Pull Request Process

1. Fill out the [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) in full.
2. Ensure CI is green (`just lint && just test`).
3. Request review; address feedback with new commits (don't force-push during review).
4. Squash-merge once approved.

## 6. Testing Requirements

Every new public function/class needs a test. See [`.agent/rules/test_writing.md`](../.agent/rules/test_writing.md).

## 7. Issue Reporting

Use the [issue templates](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) — they help both humans and coding agents triage faster.
